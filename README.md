This project is about finding the effect of covid on tuberculosis reportings . There is a government website called nikshay which will facilitate the access of data of TB Patients nationwide . Basically , this website will have data of no.of tb cases reported on a particular date in public sector and private sector and it will also have information of  in which district, state and tb unit the cases were reported. We are using this data to understand the amount of decrease in no.of TB notifications during the covid time . It's obvious that there will be a drop in no.of tb cases reported during covid times as people don't go to hospitals and though they go the wards and testing equipment are shifted to test covid . The aim of this project is to find out the accurate amount of drop in tb cases

The PHI_Extract.py contains the script to automate the extraction of PHI level data
The daily_data.py contains the script to automate the extraction of daily reported notifications TBunit wise
